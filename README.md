# check_logsCC.sh
- Description:

Modification of check_log.sh monitoring-plugins script, to allow exceptions on patterns, plus a sticky time

- Motivation:

Check_log script from the monitoring-plugins package does not handle exceptions on patterns.
It only searches for one pattern (-q query). 
I need the exit code other than OK to mantain same exit code for a fixed period of time, so Operators be aware of the problem enough time on alert console - IcingaWeb2, which is a state console, not an event console.

- Features:
  * More than one pattern can be defined which again can be classified as warning patterns and critical patterns.
  * Exceptions - If a pattern matches, the matched line could be a very special case which should not be counted as an error. You can define exception patterns which are more specific versions of your critical/warning patterns. Such a match would then cancel an alert.
  * Performance data - The number of lines scanned and the number of warnings/criticals is output.
  * Triggered actions - The script return just an exit code and a line of text, describing the result of the check. But we want to have the same exit code for a period of time even if the scripts exits with OK.

- Examples:
``` 
 icinga$ ./check_logsCC  -F /tmp/icinga2.log -O /tmp/temporalIcinga2log -c critical -w warning -ce critException -we warnException 
 ``` 
 - TODO:
   *  -- DONE!!!!Add WarningPattern and WarningException
   * Add multiple options for Patterns and Exceptions (parse yml?)
   * Add sticky time
